**🌾 Crop Production Dashboard — Excel-Based Interactive Analytics**

📊 An advanced macro-enabled Excel dashboard analyzing Indian crop production trends (1997–2020) using pivot tables, slicers, and KPI metrics.

📁 Project Overview
This project is part of my academic coursework for INT217: Introduction to Data Management at Lovely Professional University. The objective is to explore and visualize large-scale agricultural data using Microsoft Excel as a full-fledged analytical tool.

Using dynamic dashboards, this project uncovers vital insights about crop yields, seasonal trends, and state-wise production to support informed decision-making in agricultural planning and policy.
